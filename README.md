# WORDLE  

Wordle is a word guessing game. It gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above, if you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray. 

- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
- The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

In the following game of Wordle, the first guess was X, the second was X, third guess X, fourth guess is X, and then last guess is X.
